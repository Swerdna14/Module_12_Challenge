# Module_12_Challenge

In this challenge, we were tasked to see how accurate a Logistic Regression Model was at predicting credit risk. It was shown that the model had a 100% accuracy when predicting healthy loans while it was only 85% accurate predicting high-risk loans.

We then oversampled the data to see if there was any difference. It in fact made it better at predicting high-risk loans overall by 3%, with the f1 score moving from the original 88% to 91% with the oversampled data.
